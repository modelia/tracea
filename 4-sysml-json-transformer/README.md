## From SysMLv2 to Tracea-JSon

* JupyterLab export
* SysML features' trail for traceability
  * CU - AF - MF - MFV - Literal
* JSon pretty-ed

## JSon transformations for visualization and analysis

* Graph visualization with D3
* Matrix visualization

## Tracea-JSon reinjection

* Pre-Conditions
  * named links
  * separated files
* Transformation from Tracea-JSon to into SysML
