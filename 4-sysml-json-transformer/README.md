# SysML-JSon TraceaLibrary

## Library

The `TraceaLibrary` alone is available in [`/10-library`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/tree/master/4-sysml-json-transformer/10-library) with two versions of the library: with tracetypes as _strings_ and as _enum literals_. The folder contains the library sources in SysML and in JupyterLab format.

## Transformation example

`JSonTransformer` transforms a SysML model annotated with `TraceaLibrary` into three distinct representations of the model: a graphical representation using D3-JSon, a matrix-based representation and a SysML textual representation. 

A usage example of `TraceaLibrary` is given in [`/20-eDrone_example`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/tree/master/4-sysml-json-transformer/20-eDrone_example).

[`/21-eDrone_out`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/tree/master/4-sysml-json-transformer/21-eDrone_out) contains the output of JSonTransformet on this example. File containing `_out` are generated.

## Graphical representation

We use D3-JSon to generate a graphical instance of the trace. The source script to provide the following UI is found in [`/30-d3-script`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/tree/master/4-sysml-json-transformer/30-d3-script) and a usage example [`here`](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~batotedo/tracea/v1/). The following picture illustrates the UI.

## Matrix-based representation

The second output representation JSonTransformer yields is a matrix based representation as illustrated bellow and accessible [`here`](http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~batotedo/tracea/v1/eDrone_example_out.html).

## SysMLv2 re-injection

Following is an excerpt of the patch generated by JSonTransformer to reinject the example trace into the SysML model. This patch-system can also be used to populate the trace with more metadata comming from external sources.

```SysML
connection rq1ToWing connect eDroneMaxSpeed to eDrone.engine;
connection eng2front connect eDrone.engine to eDrone.frontAxis;
...
connection bod2frAx connect eDrone.body to eDrone.frontAxis;
connection bod2reAx connect eDrone.body to eDrone.rearAxis;
connection eng2bat_Typed connect eDrone.battery.powerOut to eDrone.engine.powerIn;

metadata m6854: TraceType about rq1ToWing { tracetype = "Untyped";}
metadata m9454: ConfidenceTracing about eng2front { confidence = 0.55;}
...
metadata m4155: TraceType about bod2frAx { tracetype = "Untyped";}
metadata m5704: TraceType about bod2reAx { tracetype = "Untyped";}
metadata m9888: TraceType about eng2bat_Typed { tracetype = "typeE";}
metadata m6860: TraceType about eng2bat_Typed { tracetype = "typeC";}

```

## Executable - JSonTransformer

`JSonTransformer.jar` is an executable JAR file for [`JSonTransformer`](https://github.com/ebatot/TraceaingJson). The version of the JAR corresponds to the module [`/TraceaingJSon @ 2109c56`](https://github.com/ebatot/TraceaingJson/tree/2109c562598807b8b7797af3b9dd5f54fc5c5202).

## ID allocation unexpected behavior

We report an unexpected behavior of SysMLv2 in the allocation of IDs in [`/40-sysml_id_allocation_bug`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/tree/master/4-sysml-json-transformer/40-sysml_id_allocation_bug). File `ipynb` contains a JupyterLab notebook illustrating the problem on a simple example.
