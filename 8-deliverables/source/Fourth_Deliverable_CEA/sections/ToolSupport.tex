\section{Software artefacts}\label{sec:artefacts}
The software artifacts we have implemented have been uploaded to the Modelia Git repository and can be accessed at:
\url{https://github.com/modelia/tracea/3-sysml-integration}.

The file contains the two definitions presented above along with easy-to-use and filtering examples. The respective subfolders are \verb|/kerml| and \verb|/sysml|.

SysML datatypes can be viewed in the JupyterLab of the SST. To do so, open the following link (\url{https://www.sysmlv2lab.com/}) in a web browser  and upload the code contained in \verb|/sysml/jupyterlab/TraceaTracingAnnotations.ipynb| from the Tracea Git repository. Its Markdown counterpart ($.md$) shows a \textit{Git readable} version of the Jupyter document.
