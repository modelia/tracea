\section{Software artefacts}\label{sec:artefacts}
The software artifacts we have implemented have been uploaded to the Modelia Git repository and can be accessed at:
\url{https://github.com/modelia/tracea/tree/master/4-sysml-json-transformer}.

The folder contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TraceaLibrary} in two versions: with trace types as \textit{Strings} and as \textit{Enum literals} ;
    \item An \textbf{example definition}: the definition of an eDrone in SysMLv2: architecture, requirements, definitions, and a set of traces ;
    \item The \textbf{example output} files: JSonTransformer outputs 4 files for the eDrone example, respectively to the four formats mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:syntaxrepr} ;
    \item A \textbf{D3 script} that plots a graphical visualization of Tracea models ;
    \item A \textbf{"bug" record} that depicts of a strange SysMLv2 behavior related to the allocation of IDs to "dot-notation features".
\end{itemize}

This deliverable gave birth to the JSonTransformer\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ebatot/TraceaingJson}}.
