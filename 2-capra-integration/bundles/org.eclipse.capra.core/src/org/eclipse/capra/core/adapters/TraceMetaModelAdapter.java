/**
 * This interface defines all functionality that must be implemented to support
 * a specific trace metamodel. This enables swapping the concept of what a
 * &quot;trace&quot; is, as long as these methods can be implemented.
 * 
 * Important concepts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Trace type: A trace link always has a specific type that is designated by
 * a name (e.g., "Related to" or "Implemented by"), the type of artifacts it
 * connects, and the number of artifacts that can be connected (e.g., one origin
 * artifact can be connected to several target artifacts).</li>
 * <li>Origin and Target: In general, a trace link is directed, i.e., it
 * connects one or more origin artifacts to one or more source artifacts.</li>
 * <li>Transitivity: Consider to trace links A->B and B->C. A and B as well as B
 * and C are directly connected. A and C, however, are transitively connected,
 * meaning that the connection between these elements goes via another
 * element.</li>
 * <li>Internal links: Many DSLs already contain relationships as part of the
 * constructs they support. UML, e.g., supports relationships such as
 * associations, generalisation, messages, etc. Eclipse Capra can make use of
 * such &quot;internal links&quot;. Which relationships are exposed to Eclipse
 * Capra in this way is determined by the respective handler.
 * </ul>
