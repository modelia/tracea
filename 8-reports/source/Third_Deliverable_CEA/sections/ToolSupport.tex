\section{Software artefacts}\label{sec:artefacts}

The software artifacts we have implemented have been uploaded to the Modelia Git repository and can be accessed in following URL:
\verb|https://github.com/modelia/tracea/| (folder \texttt{capra-integration}).

The repository contains an edited copy of Capra ({v8.0.2}) with a custom traceability metamodel, the extension of Connection and EMFHelper from \verb|org.eclipse.capra.core.adapters| and \verb|org.eclipse.capra.core.helpers|, and UI patches to use confidence value in the viewers.
