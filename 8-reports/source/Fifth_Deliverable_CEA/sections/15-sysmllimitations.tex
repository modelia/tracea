\section{SysMLv2 related decisions}

During this fifth deliverable we ran into the limitations pointed out in the fourth deliverable. In this section, we present these limitations. 


\subsection{Metadata feature library -- a promising idea}

The Listings \ref{lst:featurelibrary1} and \ref{lst:featurelibrary2} present our feature library {in SysML}. Listing~\ref{lst:featurelibrary1} contains the library declaration; Listing~\ref{lst:featurelibrary2} contains an example of application of such datatype  defined on a concrete example. It illustrates the allocation of a confidence value of 0.7 to a connection between a requirement (req) and a package. The second case (line 16 to 20) attributes a description and points to an element impacted (by the evaluation of the confidence),

\subsection{Model level expression -- a deceitful implementation}

When implementing these feature we ran into a number of disillusions. Fisrt and foremost, SysMLv2 implementation of the \textit{Model-level evaluable expressions} is for the least unsure. The concrete classes of the pilot implementation have been designed and written by only one developer (namely, Ed Seidewitz) and do not offer any safe guards. As showed in the previous deliverable, \Fig{fig:metadatatypes} points to where lies this limitation: when using a metadata feature, there is no guarantee for the use of "complex structures", \textit{i.e.,} that are not of basic types (int, double, String, ...). If used, these complex structure will at best show an error as pictured in \Fig{fig:filtererr}, and at worst keep the fallacious state of the system silent and leave the system out of its requirements.
