\section{Limitations due to SysMLv2 dependence}\label{sec:limitation}
\sideboxbegin{o}
This section presents the limitation encountered while integrating the functionalities of Trace\textit{a} into SysMLv2.
\sideboxend

During this fifth deliverable we ran into the limitations pointed out in the fourth deliverable.
In this section, we present these limitations \ughu{and debrief on the exchange with the SysMLv2 Submission team.} 
 
\subsection{Metadata feature library -- a promising idea}

The Listings \ref{lst:featurelibrary1} and \ref{lst:featurelibrary2} present our feature library {in SysML}. Listing~\ref{lst:featurelibrary1} contains the library declaration; Listing~\ref{lst:featurelibrary2} contains an example of application of such datatype  defined on a concrete example. It illustrates the allocation of a confidence value of 0.7 to a connection between a requirement (req) and a package. The second case (line 16 to 20) attributes a description and points to an element impacted (by the evaluation of the confidence),

\subsection{Model level expression -- a deceitful implementation}

To avoid modifying the fundamental elements of {KerML}, our second idea was to redefine an annotation type dedicated to tracing. To do this, a TracingAnnotation links a Relationship to a TracingElement just as an annotation links an Element to an AnnotatingElement. \ugh{.....................................}

Nonetheless, the concept of annotation is to be retained here -- it suits perfectly the idea of traceability \textit{orthogonal} to the software. With tracing annotation, a change in the traced elements does not necessarily impact the tracing elements, and vice versa.
