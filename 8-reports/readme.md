# Tracea - Reports

Reports for each deliverable together with their respective Latex source code:

1. [`Survey of traceability techniques`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/blob/master/8-reports/Tracea_Deliverable_1_CEA.pdf) with a focus on their applications in AI-based software techniques
2. [`Traceability language -- Definition and editors`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/blob/master/8-reports/Tracea_Deliverable_2_CEA.pdf) An Xtext project generated from ECore language artefacts.
3. [`Traceability solutions -- Evaluation and extensions`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/blob/master/8-reports/Tracea_Deliverable_3_CEA.pdf) Guidelines to evaluate a traceability solutions, extension to Explainable traces.
4. [`Trustable traceability for SysMLv2s`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/blob/master/8-reports/Tracea_Deliverable_4_CEA.pdf) A metadata feature library dedicated to tracing SysMLv2 connections.
5. [`Visualizable and propagable SysMLv2 traces for metadata analysiss`](https://github.com/modelia/tracea/blob/master/8-reports/Tracea_Deliverable_5_CEA.pdf) A tool suite to extract, visualize (and some day, hopefully, edit) trace artefacts from a SysMLv2 model.
